Create a script that prompts the user for a number.
That number is to be used to display a simple message to the terminal X number of times (where X is the number captured from the user input).
The message should include an indication of the number for each count the message is displayed.

     for (( b=1 ; b <=a ; b++ ))
      do
      echo "$b" "Hello"
      done
