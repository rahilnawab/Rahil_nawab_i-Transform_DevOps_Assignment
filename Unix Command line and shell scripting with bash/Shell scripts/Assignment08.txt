You will want to prompt the user to enter the following information (which you will capture and place into the following variables):

FIRSTNAME
LASTNAME
USERAGE

Greet the user with their name and current age displayed and then calculate and display their age in 10 years.



script
---->#!/usr/bin/env bash
     # File: user.sh

     echo "Type your First name and Last name and then press Enter:"
     read var lasn

     echo "Type your age and then press Enter:"
     read varn

     ashg=$(($varn + 10))

     echo "Hello $var $lasn your current age is $varn, after 10 years your age will be $ashg"


$bash user.sh
