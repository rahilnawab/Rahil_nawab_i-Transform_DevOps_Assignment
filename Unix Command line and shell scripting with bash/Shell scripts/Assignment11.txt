Create a script that interacts with the user.
Prompt them to guess a secret number between 1 and 5.
Read the guess from the terminal and assign it to a variable.
Using the 'if' statement from the course, test that value to determine if they guessed the right number (you choose the correct value).
 If they do, isplay a success message, otherwise do nothing.

 ---->#!usr/bin/env bash
      #File:guess.sh

      echo "Guess the number between 1 & 5 and then press Enter:"
      read v1

      if [[ $v1 -eq 3 ]]
      then
	      echo "You entered the correct number"
	      echo "Program ends"
      fi

  $ bash guess.sh
