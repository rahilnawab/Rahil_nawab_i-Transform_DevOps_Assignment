Write a script that sets FOUR variables:

MYUSERNAME
MYPASSWORD
STARTOFSCRIPT
ENDOFSCRIPT

Populate the first two with some default value and use command redirection to set the third and fourth value to the date/time of when the script was started and completed.
Within the script, be sure to display the values to the terminal when run.


SCRIPT:
---->#!/usr/bin/env bash
     # File: dat.sh

     echo "Type in a username and then press Enter:"
     read my_name

     echo "Type in a password and then press Enter:"
     read pass
     echo "My username: $my_name"
     echo "Password: *******"

     date '+DATE: %m/%d/%y%nTIME:%H:%M:%S' > time.txt
     cat time.txt


$ bash dat.sh
