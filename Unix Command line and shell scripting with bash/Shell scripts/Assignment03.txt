Develop a script that creates, sets and displays two variables to the terminal when run.
Within this script, add comments to explain what the script is doing, what each variable is and, using inline comments, what each command is doing.

script
---->#!/usr/bin/env bash
     # File: var.sh

     echo "Type the first variable name and then press Enter:"  #asking user for first variable name
     read var

     echo "Type the second variable name and then press Enter:" #asking user for second variable name
     read varn

     echo "setting vaiarbles"
     export "$var"                                              #setting the variable
     export "$varn"                                             #setting the variable

     echo "$var"                                                #displaying the variable
     echo "$varn"                                               #displaying the variable


$bash var.sh
