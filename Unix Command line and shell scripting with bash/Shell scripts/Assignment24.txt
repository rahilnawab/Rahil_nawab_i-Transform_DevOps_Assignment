We are going to use nested functions to simulate the kind of abstraction you find in many object oriented languages.
Create the following structures in your script:

A function that defines two local variables to hole the number of arms and legs that a human being has.
Nested functions, one for each a male and female, that contain the appropriate number of beards that each gender has.
Capture the gender as a command line parameter.
Test the command line parameter and call the appropriate functions in order to display the characteristics of the indicated gender.

script
---->#!/usr/bin/env bash

     gender () {
     local arms=2
     local legs=2
     f="Female"
     if [[ $1 == $f ]]
     then
        Female;
     else
        Male;
    fi
    }
      Female() {
        echo "Female"
      }

      Male() {
        echo "Male"
      }

      func=$(gender $1)
      echo "$func"
