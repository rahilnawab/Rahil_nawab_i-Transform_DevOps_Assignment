Write a script that will prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 3.
Capture that number in a variable and then test that variable.
Be sure to display the variable and it's value as appropriate within an if/then/else statement where the final statement will display if they did not enter a number between 1 and 3 telling them they failed to follow instructions.
Redirect errors from each of the tests to /dev/null (to prevent script errors from showing if text is entered for example).


script
---->#!usr/bin/env bash
     #File:correct.sh

     echo "Enterthe number between 1 & 3 and then press Enter:"
     read v1

     if [[ $v1 -ge 1 ]] && [[ $v1 -le 3 ]]
     then
       echo "Appropiate number entered"
     else
       echo $v1 > /dev/null
     fi


  $ bash correct.sh
