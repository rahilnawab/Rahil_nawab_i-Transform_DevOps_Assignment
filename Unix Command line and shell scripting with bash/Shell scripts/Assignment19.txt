We need to create a menu for our users.
Display a menu containing three choices AND a choice to allow them to exit.
Display that menu and prompt for a choice. Upon choosing the value, it should simply clear the screen and redisplay the menu (loop until the exit choice is given).

HOWEVER, we need to be sure that the end user cannot use CTL-C, CTL-Z or a KILL command to terminate the application.
Add a 'trap' in the script to capture those attempts and provide instructions on how to exit the script using the menu choice instead.


script
---->trap
     while true
     do
     clear
     echo " MENU "
     echo "Enter 1"
     echo "Enter 2"
     echo "Enter 3"
     echo "Enter quit to quit"

     read c

     case $c in
     1) echo "You entered one" ;;
     2) echo "You entered two" ;;
     3) echo "You entered three" ;;
     "quit") exit
     esac
     done
